Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience across devices.
Tech News: Fetches live post data from the school’s API for real-time updates.

Inspiration & References
The project draws inspiration from multiple sources to implement various features. Notably:

The carousel feature was inspired by an article:
"How to Build a Simple Carousel with Vanilla JavaScript".
You can find the API documentation here:
Noroff API Documentation.
The website’s style guide and wireframes were designed by me. Links to these assets are shared outside this README.
