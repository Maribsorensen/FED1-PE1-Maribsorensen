All post data is fetched from the school’s API, providing dynamic content updates.

## Inspiration & References

The project draws inspiration from multiple sources to implement various features. Notably:

- The **carousel feature** was inspired by an article:  
  ["How to Build a Simple Carousel with Vanilla JavaScript"](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/how-to-build-a-simple-carousel-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-41734t).
- You can find the **API documentation** here:  
  [Noroff API Documentation](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2).

The website’s **style guide** and **wireframes** were designed by me. Links to these assets are shared outside this README.

## Testing

The following tools were used to test the website:

- **WAVE**: Accessibility testing.
- **Google Lighthouse**: Performance and SEO testing.
- **W3C Markup Validation Service**: Ensuring the HTML is valid
